## Current Changes

### 2026-09-02 - `97674dd` Shared Rate Limiting And Account Lockout

- Changed: PostgreSQL-backed, hashed-client rate limits; five failed password attempts lock an existing account for 15 minutes.
- Affects: database migration `20260902120000_add_shared_rate_limiting_and_login_lockout`, authentication, registration, password-reset, admin email-test, and page-view APIs.
- Environment: apply the migration. Set `RATE_LIMIT_HASH_SECRET` to a unique secret, or rate-limit identifiers fall back to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
- Validation: editor diagnostics and whitespace checks passed. Run migration replay, type check, and rate-limit tests under Node 20.

### 2026-09-02 - `5429973` Active Session Claim Revalidation

- Changed: server session access reloads suspension, role membership, Owner, and Accountant flags; JWT lifetime is eight hours.
- Affects: all protected server pages and APIs using `getCurrentUser` or `requireRole`.
- Environment: no new configuration or migration.
- Validation: add and run suspension, role-revocation, and multi-role session tests.

### 2026-09-02 - `e676e12` Render-Gated Deployment Path

- Changed: Render auto-deploy disabled; protected GitHub workflows deploy approved SHAs through Render hooks.
- Affects: `render.yaml`, staging/production deployment workflows, release operations.
- Environment: `RENDER_STAGING_DEPLOY_HOOK` and `RENDER_PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_HOOK` are configured as protected GitHub environment secrets. Apply the blueprint and run an approved staging deployment.
- Validation: record a successful staging deployment and exact deployed SHA.

### 2026-09-02 - `6377097` Payment And Tender Workflow Controls

- Changed: recoverable Stripe webhook finalisation, payment reversal ledger and revocation, contact-release message gate, and tender expiry enforcement.

- Validation: run PostgreSQL integration tests for retries, reversals, release gating, and closed/expired tenders.

### 2026-09-02 - `45c0dfd` Retailer Matching And Delivery District

- Changed: retailer match ranking uses raw server-side location; pre-unlock views show only broad area plus postcode district; full postcode remains restricted until unlock.
- Affects: retailer opportunity/dashboard/detail views and tender summary API.
- Environment: no migration; existing tender locations are formatted dynamically.
- Validation: run geography and retailer opportunity tests under Node 20.
